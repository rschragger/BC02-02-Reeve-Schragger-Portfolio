        <h2>Ability to attract</h2>
        <div>
            <p><img class="articleImg" src="../assets/images/Peacock.JPG" alt="Peacock">The male peacock needs to attract a mate in a most obvious way. His tail feathers fan out to create an eye catching display. <br>In business, the difference between success and failure can also be affected by the ability to attract customers. Whilst a gauche display like a peacock is frowned upon, that is an evolutionary circumstance. We humans have evolved our <em>fashion sense</em> so that we make attractive displays that do not cross bounds of taste. We also need to balance that with the ability to cut through all the other activity that assaults us daily.<br>With my grounding in an Industrial Design degree, and from working within the digital design industry for over 25 years, I have worked on innumerable projects where we used intelligent design to make attractive products.<br>

        <h2>Strength of purpose</h2>
        <div>
            <p>The important thing about attraction is that there needs to be a strength behind the initial pull. I am very happy to let <em>fashionistas</em> in my team worry over look and feel, because my talent is making the customer stick once they have given us a chance. Giving the customers not only what they want, but also what they didn't know they needed. One must be able to see the clients' pain points and blaze a trail of usability and effectiveness.<br>
