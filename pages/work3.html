            <p><img class="articleImg" src="../assets/images/Snake.JPG" alt="Snake">Lots of people don't like snakes. <br>I understand, but that doesn't mean they should be exterminated. Snakes are an integral part of the ecosystem and their absence would be incredibly devastating. <br>
            This is the same attitude we need to bring to a lot of our work. There is a lot of work which is very unnattractive and painful, there ios some work that is even dangerous. The lesson here is that we need to not only engage with it, we also need to celebrate it and give it the necessary respect. <br>
        Too many people run away from these duties and responsibilities. My attitude is to confront it head on, learn what is happening and then make ways to achieve success whilst not cutting any corners. Huge efficiency gains have been found in these <em>un-sexy</em> duties and great profits in time and money can be achieved by this analysis and re-work.</p>
